# Data_Science_and_Analytics_Portfolio
Welcome, I am currently working on improving and refining my skills with Pandas/python for data science and analytics. This is a centralized location for all of my notes, code, documentation, and results. It is a work in progress, and I will be updating it regularly. It is also meant to act as a portfolio and demonstrate my skills and abilities in these fields. Please refer to my most up to date uploads for each branch, if that is what you are interested in. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me at mleifeld15@gmail.com. Thanks.
